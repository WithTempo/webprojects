properties - 
a big question is whethere a property will be applied to the
parent or to the child

order - the order of your childs items
by default, everything has an order of 0, so
they'll be arranged by the order of their html,
if you wanted to change that, you could set the order.

.green {
    order: 1
}

this will send it to the end as it has an order
higher than the rest

flex-wrap
useful when you run out of space on the horizontal

normally, if there are too many itmes or some of the items are longer,
then it will just continue pushing and collapsing until they can't be collapsed
anymore where they will go off the end of the page.

change: 

    flex-wrap: wrap

content and elements will wrap around on the next line.

flex-wrap is a property of the parent, the container, and
determines how all the children should behave.


justify-content: flex-start; everything bunched up to the left (default)
                 flex-end will push everything to the right.

if all the items have arleady taken up all the space, then it wont' behave the same

justify-content: center; will just put it in the center, very easy. 
justify-content: space-between; evenly distributes the space between the elements
justify-content: space-around kind of similar but theres space to the left and right 
                of the first and last elements respectively wherease space between
                will ensure the first and last elements are at the very beginning and end

align-items: flex-start
this is the position of the item along the cross-axis, set on the container
if the container is only taking up one row, then we won't see anything,
for this to work we have to set the height of the container
we set to 

70vh where vh is viewport height.
100 is the entire height

vw = viewport width

align-items: flex-end -> everything starts at the bottom
align-items: center;

align-self: property set on child elements, allows that item to act
independently

align-content is similar to align item but only works when flex-wrap is set to wrap
you want to specify how the content should align.
