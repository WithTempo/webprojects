moof predominant colors convey something

red - entergetic

green - freshness, growth, safety
blue - stabiity, trust, serentity (financial companies)
purple - royalty, wealth, femininity (payday loan companies)

make a conscious decision when choosing a colors
combinging colors:
analogous color pallette, colors next to each other on color wheels (navigation or logo and background)

oppositie colors are complementary on color wheel, clash and 'pop' - use for maybe logos or icons or things you want
to stand out.
don't use for regular text and background, they'll make your eyes hurt

TYPOGRAPHY

consider how to combine different fonts to make your design look professional
serif vs non serif
serif - has feet - historically, you'll notice these little feet, why? once you chisel needs to exit, it's impossible to create 90 degree angles so you had to do it like this
older, authoritative, legal, magazine, architectural

old style, traiditional, odern, slab-style. - the difference is the thickest vs thinnest part of the letter
authoritative and modern - or old style for winery etc.

serif - tradiitional stable, respectful, authortitative - cogue - serif typeface

sans-serifs - perfect right-angles, no little feet. much more friently, contemporary and approachable. 
highly readable, sans-serifs for bodies of texts. 

how easy the words are to readable
mit study - humanist stypeface
readability and legibility are open shapes and a lot of space, unambiguious g vs 9, wide O, 
people go overboard and choose 10 fonts in the same design
actually just stick with 2 -cleaner and tighter

try to go for similar moods and time eras, you don't want traditional and modern
create intereset by changing different font-weights in head and body

Manage Attention with interactive user interface

User Interface design
define hierarchy using color (already discussed)
size - bigger items draw your eyes

optimal line length  - 40 to 60 characters per line

alignment - consistency - reduce number of alignment points or lines, it makes it look more coherent and proefessional

luxury shops use white space around products and space them out to make them look more expensive, too many items looks like a discount store

same with ui - minimilast and eleveation

audience - consider your audience


user experience -
meant to be invisible, how a website feels to use (effortless)

simplicity, keep things simple
consistency
reading-patterns

F-pattern - using heat maps to track user engagement, people read in an 'F-pattern' that is they start at the beginning of the line
and move to the right,
put the most important parts of your content on the left gutter, have the logo at the top and have everything following this pattern

Z-pattern - left to right then zig zag down to the bototm left and across to the bottom right
-something with sparse content, a big video, maybe facebook website

all platform design - you have to think about mobile, desktop, tablets, everything responsive
make sure your website re-arranges itself baed on the dimensions of the device which is viewing the website

avoid too many banners -
but don't make your entire website just one part a picture or a piece of text scaled up massively
then people have to just keep scrolling forever


test-test-testget feedback from users, family, friends 

don't use your powers for evil - 
patterns which get the usre to perform behaviors that are good for a complementary
tricking people into paying more
hair on the screen
ryan-air, charges you for every single thing
checkboxes with confusing wording

web design together
daily ui
collect ui
applying four pillars
canva - quickly throw together and visualize a website ( no functionality)
