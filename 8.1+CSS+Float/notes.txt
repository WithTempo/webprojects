If we want our text to wrap around an element,
 this requires us to use the float property.

    <img.../>
    <p>text...</p>

    img {
        float:left;
    }

    this will make the text wrap around the image > no setings on the text, only the float: left property on the image element

    float right will do the same except the image would be on the right and the text on the left

    sometimes you don't want your text to wrap around an image, such as is the case when you have a footer. In this case you need
    to use another property called 'clear'

    target footer:

    footer {
        clear:left;
    }

    definitely don't use float for overly complex layouts because it will end up looking
    all janky, instead just use it for text wrap and there are other tools you will
    use later in order to make complex layouts
