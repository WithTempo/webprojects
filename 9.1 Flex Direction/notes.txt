FLEX-DIRECTION

normally in html, elements will stack horizontally and overflow onto the next line, top to bottom.

with flexbox, as soon as everythign goes in a flexible container go on the same row
the reason for this is there is a property called flex direction, which by default is set to row.

cross-axis is perpendicutlar to the horizontal axis

flex-direction: column;
then it will make each element inside the flex container go from top to bottom

flex-basis: 100px;
this is going to expand the elements vertically along the main axis to 100px each;
if instead of having the main axis vertical, we have flex-direction set to row and the main axis is horizontal,
now when we set the flex-basis, isntead of height, it will set the width of each of the items inside the container
to satisfy the requirement. 

the property modifiers are 'flexing' along the main axis. that why the main and cross axis matter so much.
