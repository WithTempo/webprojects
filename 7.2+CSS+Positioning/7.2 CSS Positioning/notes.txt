4 different values for position property:
STATIC, RELATIVE, ABSOLUTE, FIXED

STATIC: html default, basically means that each item flows 
    as they would in html.
    EX:
        box {
            position: static;
        }

RELATIVE: Item is placed relative to default location,
    use top, right, bottom, and/or left to apply the position change relative 
    from the default location. for example:

    box {
        position: relative;
        left; 50px;
        top; 50px;
    }

    will shift the box from it's default location 50px down
    and 50px to the right.

ABSOLUTE: position relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
    or the top left corner of the webpage (the html block).
    An absolutely positioned element is removed from the normal
    document flow meaning it does not affect the position of 
    other elements and can actually overlap them.

        Ex:
            box {
                position: absolute;
                top: 100px;
                right: 100px;
            }
        
        will psoition the box 100 pixels down and left from
        it's nearest ancestor

    Z-index, absolute psitioning lets you set a z-axis property
    which determines which elements sit on top or beneath
    other elements. 

            box {
                z-index: 0;
            }

        this positions the box as the absolute top

FIXED:
    WILL BE POSITIONED RELATIVE TO THE TOP LET CORNER OF THE 
    THE BROWSER WINDOW, BUT WILL STAY WHERE IT IS REGARDLESS
    OF WHERE YOU SCROLL. 'THINK SIDE MENUS'

        EX:
            box {
                position: fixed;
                left: 50px;
                top: 50px;
            }
