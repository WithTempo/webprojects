12 column layout system

3 components 

first a div clasa container

inside container another div which will be of class row
and inside that will be our dolumn system
<div class="container">
    <div class=" row">
        <div class="col">Hello</div>
    </div>
</div>

automatically bootstrap will give every column equal space

container is responsive

container sizes depending on screens
extra small, small, medium,large, x-large, xxlarge

width of viewport
.container 100%
.container-sm 540px
.container-md 720px
.container-lg 960px
.container-xl 1140px
.container-xxl 1320px
.container-fluid -> will change depending on screen size?

instead of writing column, we set the calss as col-2, col-4, 

how to specify how wide the clumns are? based on the classes you choose.

col-1 will be teh smallest, col-12 will be the largest, they have to add up to 12.

looks like this:

<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-2">Hello</div>
        <div class="col-4">Hello</div>
        <div class="col-6">Hello</div>
    </div>
</div>

didn't even have to write any css, just include the link in the html <head> 

don't need media queries, becasue bootstrap breakpoints take care of this
multiple breakpoints

class="col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-lg-4"

this means on small devices like phones, the div will take up 12 columns or the whole screen,
whilst on medium devices such as ipads or tablet, it will take up 2/3rds of the screen,
and on large devices such as laptops or desktop monitors, it will take up 1/3 or the screen.

you can mix and match
