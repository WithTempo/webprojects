Display elements:
Span - has a default display element set to inline

ex: <h2>Harry</h2>
    <h2>Potter </h2>

    default:

        h2 {
            display: inline;
        }

    display set to inline by default


BLOCK, INLINE, INLINE-BLOCK

Block will take out the entire full width
if you have another element, then it will appear below it and not on the same line.

if you have two elements and the display is inline, 2 spans will go on the same line until it will no longer fit and then go to the next line.

you can't set the width/size of these elements, they will always default.

inline-block: halfway between. the block element allows us to set height and width, the inline lets us have elements that go ont he same line. 

if you had two blocks, one 200x200 and one 20x100, with inline block, they will go on the same horizontal line as long as there is space

display:non -> element will disappear from the screen. 



so block takes up the whole horizontal width until the next line

inline will fit as much as it can before overflowing to the next line.
however, the height and width will only be as large as the content of th element

inline-block will fit everything on the same line, but gives you control over the size of the element.
